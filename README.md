- 👋 Hi, I’m @ffghdfh
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (especially in golang), creating fun things and messing around with coding
- 🌱 I’m currently coding mostly in golang, but i know python / html js css too!
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate unless it's a personal project sorgy
- 📫 How to reach me: either via my discord; chair_senpai or via my email; bejelentkezesre@gmail.com
